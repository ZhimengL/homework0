```{r solution, echo=FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2

# Compute delta
Delta <- b^2 - 4*a*c

# Calculate the solutions using calculated delta
if (Delta > 0) {
  x1 <- (-b + sqrt(Delta)) / (2*a)
  x2 <- (-b - sqrt(Delta)) / (2*a)
  solutions <- c(x1, x2)
} else if (Delta == 0) {
  x1 <- -b / (2*a)
  solutions <- x1
} else {
  solutions <- NULL
}

solutions

x <- seq(-3, 1, length = 300)

plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")

abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

```
We can see from the plot that the function intersects to the line y=0 twice when x=-1 and x=-2, indicating there are 2 solutions for the function, which is consistent as what we solved.
