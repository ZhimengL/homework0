## Solution and Plot

```{r solution}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2

# Compute delta
Delta <- b^2 - 4*a*c

# Calculate the solutions using calculated delta
if (Delta > 0) {
  x1 <- (-b + sqrt(Delta)) / (2*a)
  x2 <- (-b - sqrt(Delta)) / (2*a)
  solutions <- c(x1, x2)
} else if (Delta == 0) {
  x1 <- -b / (2*a)
  solutions <- x1
} else {
  solutions <- NULL
}

solutions

x <- seq(-3, 3, length = 300)

plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")

abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

```
## Explanation
From the plot, it's clear that the function intersects the line y=0 at x=−1 and x=−2, confirming the two solutions we derived. If the function had only one solution, the plot would show a single intersection point, and if there were no solutions, no intersections would be observed."
